    "P1": "P2PL is one of the most innovative P2PL products of recent times. It enables creditworthy borrowers lower their cost of loans and individual lenders/investors to lend directly to their peers and community thereby earning higher returns.",
    "P2": "What we at P2PL.com essentially do is provide a virtual market place where borrowers and lenders can interact directly, without having to go through the traditional financial intermediaries like banks, who have become such behemoths in today’s time that they dictate all terms and conditions for both borrowers and lenders. Faircent is India's first P2PL lending platform to receive a Certificate of Registration (CoR) as an NBFC-P2P from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).",
    "P3": "Banks have massive overheads, with thousands of employees to pay and hundreds of branches to maintain. To maintain profitability, banks must take large margins on the money that passes through them.. Earning out of the difference in interests (what it pays to depositors and what it charges from borrowers) is the main source of revenue for any bank, and has been the key element in the functioning of all traditional financial institutions.",
    "P4": "We at Faircent help eliminate the high margins which banks and financial institutions make on your transactions. Our format allows us to keep institutional charges at a bare minimum and we simply pass on this benefit to you.",
    "P5": "Thus, whether you are a Borrower or a Lender, you get the best rates at Faircent. Because we know every % counts!",

    "Frequently Asked Questions": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "Q1": "How much can I borrow?",
    "A1": "You can borrow between Rs. 5000 and Rs. 5,00,000",
    "Q2": "Over what time frame can I borrow?",
    "A2": "You can borrow minimum for 6 months and maximum for 36 months.",
    "Q3": "Can I repay my loan early if I like?",
    "A3": " Yes, and there is no prepayment penalty while at the same time, banks charge 2-4%",
    "Q4": "What rates can I expect to pay?",
    "A4": " Interest rates depend on the credentials of Borrowers and the ongoing demand of Investors. They can only be finalized once the concerned Borrower and Investor agree mutually on a particular rate.",
    "Q5": "Why was my listing declined?",
    "A5": " This may have happened if the verification process for your application failed.",
    "Q6": "What happens in case of delayed or non-payment of EMI?",
    "A6": " In case the EMI is not paid by the due date, additional penal interest of 2% p.m. will be applied to the amount due for the duration of delay which Borrowers will be liable to pay their Investor(s) + collection charges of Rs. 500 will be charged to the Borrower.",
    "Q7": "How are repayments calculated?",
    "A7": "Repayments are equated monthly installments calculated using the reducing balance method. Your installment per month will remain the same throughout the tenure of your loan. The first installment may be different depending on the date of disbursal.",
    "Q8": "What information can be viewed about me?",
    "A8": "Once your listing has been approved, your entire public profile can be viewed by all registered Investors. However, we plan not to share private information but would like to verify them on the behalf of Investors. Your financial information is shown to the Investor by default as this helps you get a loan faster. However, you have the option to block this information. You can interact with investors over messages. Financial information on your profile will not be visible to general visitors.",
    "Q9": "Are there any hidden charges?",
    "A9": "No. Everything is transparently explained on the website and you will receive the Statement of Account that will show the details. We pride ourselves on our system's transparency.",
    "Q10": "Can I make one-off payments?",
    "A10": " Yes, with no penalty.",
    "Q11": "Can I change the amount I want to borrow after applying?",
    "A11": "No, as the rate and the amount was agreed. To increase the loan amount, you can create a fresh loan request for the difference",
    "Q12": "Can I be both, a Investor and a Borrower?",
    "A12": "No. At this time, you can be either Investor or Borrower. We are working on the operational feasibility of such a scenario.",
    "What is ILP-P2P": "What is P2PL",
    "W1": "This is a money lending mechanism, where creditors and borrowers are equal parties (individuals and / or companies) and the process is carried out without the participation of intermediaries in the form of banks, credit brokers and other traditional financial institutions. In most cases, such relationships are built on the Internet at special sites - P2P platforms.",
    "W2": " Without intermediaries, the interest rate is lower and the investor’s profit is greater. The fact is that maintaining a bank is an expensive pleasure. It is necessary to rent or purchase premises, staff, buy computer equipment and special software. And follow all safety rules.",
    "W3": "Multiply these expenses by several branches, and you will understand why in the same bank the credit rate can be at the level of 10%, and the deposit rate - 2%. The bank eats up most of the profits of investors.",
    "W4": " In P2PL lending does not need to take into account the cost of banking real estate, staff salaries and expensive equipment. Therefore, the loan rate can be at the level of 10%, and the investor&#39;s benefit - 8%. The remaining 2% will leave the P2P platform.",
    "Such lending works in a simple way:": "Such lending works in a simple way:",
    "Such-P1": "The borrower submits an application for a loan, specifying the amount,terms of the loan and brief information about himself.",
    "Such-P2": "The platform assesses the risk, determines the credit rating and sets the appropriate interest rate. This is done by oracles (people or organizations hired from outside) and / or special algorithms.",
    "Such-P3": "The application goes to the total pool that lenders view.",
    "Such-P4": "If the loan conditions are suitable for any of the lenders, a loan agreement is made.",
    "Such-P5": "The only difficulty is the P2PL platform itself. The site should be comfortable, reliable, secure and support a large number of languages (this will increase the reach of the audience). It is difficult to create such a platform, but if you approach this wisely, you will have every chance of success.",
    "How It Works": "How It Works",
    "HQ1": "How does a P2PL loan work?",
    "HQ2": "How does the lending process differ between a P2PL loan and a bank?",
    "HQ3": "What happens next in the application process?",
    "HQ4": "Borrowing through P2P Platforms",
    "HQ5": "Investing through P2P Platforms",
    "HQP1": "P2PL loans take online lending to the next level, directly pairing borrowers with investors in a virtual platform. It’s a unique alternative to traditional banking and often comes with lower interest rates for borrowers and higher yields for investors.",
    "HQP2": "ILP-P2P cuts out a lot of the costs generally associated with taking out loans through a bank. There are no physical branches to support and staffing is generally a much less substantial expense for P2P companies.",
    "HQP3": "From the borrower’s perspective, the application process starts much of the same way as any other loan process. Most ILP-P2P platforms allow for prequalification that only requires a soft credit pull, giving you an idea of what kind of personal loan you could qualify for and with what terms. At this point, you’re also given a loan grade, which classifies your application as a risk rating.",
    "HQP4": "Next, your funding request is posted on the P2P platform. Investors can review the details of your inquiry, such as what you’ll use your loan funds for, non-identifying aspects of your application, and their anticipated return. If interested, the investor can then commit any amount of funds to your personal loan. Once you reach a certain percentage of committed funding, your loan application moves onto the next level.",
    "HQP5": "You’ll need to submit information to verify your application, like proof of income and any other documentation required by the lender. It then goes to underwriting and you’ll receive an official loan agreement outlining the details of the loan, including rates, terms, and your repayment responsibilities.",
    "HQP6": "After you sign and submit the loan agreement, the loan funds are typically deposited into your bank account within 24 to 48 hours.",
    "HQP7": "Because there are extra steps involved in the approval process for a P2P loan, it cantake longer to get your funding when compared to other lenders. On the plus side, however, borrowers can often qualify for more competitive rates and terms.",
    "HQP8": "And since there’s upfront transparency to investors regarding each borrower’s credit rating, low credit borrowers may still get the chance to qualify for a loan, even if they’ve been denied by other lenders.",
    "HQP9": "P2P platforms also offer a wide degree of flexibility on loan use. While they’re all different, most generally allow for common funding purposes such as debt consolidation, home improvements, life events, and other major purchases. Your exact need could influence which P2P lender you ultimately choose.",
    "HQP10": "Investors are often drawn to P2PL platforms for the pure fact that returns are often higher than other investment choices. Plus you get to administer as much control as you’d like when managing your portfolio. That’s because you can pick and choose how much you invest at any given moment, in addition to what mix of loan grades you want in your portfolio.",
    "HQP11": "Alternatively, you’re also able to set your investments on autopilot with most of them.You generally can input how you’d like your investments to be distributed, and the lender will then automatically disburse your funds to loan requests that meet your criteria.",
    "HQP12": "This frees you up from having to manually review borrower requests, making the process as simple as you want it to be. While ILP-P2P certainly contains a large degree of risk, some investors may choose to make it a part of their portfolios.",

All you need to do is study the product and then go ahead with the investment",
    "NP2": "I leveraged Faircent to consolidate outstanding amount from all my credit cards and avoid paying exorbitant interest rate and other charges. The entire process was clearly explained by Faircent Representative and I felt that zero foreclosure charges was a huge advantage. Overall quite satisfied with the entire process. It was fair and hassle free.",
    "NP3": "I am a doctor and took loan through Faircent to set-up my own clinic. Since I was taking loan for the first time, they really supported and guided me. They helped me through the procedure and gave further information at every step. Follow-up was really good.",

    "NP5": "This isn’t some complex theory one needs to crack, it is simple and doable by merely following a few golden rules in investing. It is good to start investing with a detailed plan and I would say high-risk funds are better as it can give ‘wings’ to your 'investments'.",
    "NP6": "I took a loan from Faircent.com for my sister’s wedding. The experience was very good as the system is very transparent. I suggest people who are looking for immediate loan must apply on Faircent.com and feel the difference.",
